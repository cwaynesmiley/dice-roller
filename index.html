      <h1>Dice Roller FTW!</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this is to have my own application or web-based application that I can use to roll dice in case I forget mine at home (cause I'm a nerd that likes to play games that need dice).</p>
      <p>As this will be my first attempt at creating such a dice roller it will be fairly rudimentary, I'm thinking just d4, d6, d10, d12, and d20's.  You'll have the option of adding multiple dice (eg. 2d6 or 4d4) but not be able to program presets of dice rolls nor have the option of adding in bonuses and minuses.  Those will come in a later version as I get better with Javascript and other coding languages.</p>
